  <h3>Research Overview</h3>
    <p>
      I study how culture transformed humans—a run-of-the-mill tropical ape—into one of the most successful species on Earth. Understanding how humans came to occupy virtually every terrestrial habitat is one of the fundamental scientific challenges of our time. The key to human ecological success is our reliance on socially transmitted information. My research investigates how biological evolution gave rise to this secondary inheritance system, how biology and culture interact and differ, and their respective roles in shaping human behavior and technologies. I address these questions using models and comparative analyses of ethnographic and archaeological data. A complementary aim of my work is to show how archaeological data, with its macro-scale perspective, can uniquely contribute to understanding cultural evolution </p>
